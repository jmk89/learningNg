# Ng4CompleteGuide

This is a a repository for me to get comfortable with github while learning Angular.
I'll try and keep things organized...

## Commits

These will be probably more granular than some people would do. However,
I want to have a good reference for when I need to look up how to 
do something later.

## Tags

Generally tags will align with the sections in which I'm implementing
the previous lesson into the main Recipe Book project.
