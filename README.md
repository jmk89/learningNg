# Ng4CompleteGuide

This is a a repository for me to get comfortable with github while learning Angular.
I'll try and keep things organized...

## ngrx

This was implemented during Section 24, and I kind of regret doing it.
I've got a basic grasp on rxjs operators and design patterns, and ngrx
takes it to another level. I'm keeping it for now, but I might rollback the 
ngrx implementation before I finish the course.

## Commits

These will be probably more granular than some people would do. However,
I want to have a good reference for when I need to look up how to 
do something later. The commits line up with each video from the
course on Udemy (Angular - The Complete Guide (2022 Edition))

## Tags

Generally tags will align with the sections in which I'm implementing
the previous lesson into the main Recipe Book project.
